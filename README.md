###Collaboration Instructions

1. Fork JST from here: https://github.com/davidmccoy/jst

2. Go to your JST fork
  * copy your ssh key
  * ```$ git clone git@github.com:ghostropic/jst.git``` (creates the rails folder)
  * make sure you are outside of any other git repos

3. ```$ git remote -v``` (prints to terminal remote repos)

4. ```$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:davidmccoy/jst.git```
  * this will make it so you can pull from GitHub
  * just make sure you push __your branch__ to origin __your branch__, and then send a pull request ((similar to homework submission)
  * don't push to upstream master
  * you can then make a pull request
