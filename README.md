###Collaboration Instructions

1) fork David's jst from here : https://github.com/davidmccoy/jst

2) a. go to your jst fork
b. copy your ssh key
c. $git clone git@github.com:ghostropic/jst.git (creates the rails folder)
- make sure you are outside of any repos. I was in my /dev folder when I did step c.

3) git remote -v (prints to terminal remote repos)

4) $git remote add upstream git@github.com:davidmccoy/jst.git

5) git remote -v

Step 2 makes it so you can push to origin master of your fork and then make pull requests to David M.

step 4 makes it so you can push to upstream without David's permission.
